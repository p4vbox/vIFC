# vIFC

In this repo you will find vIFC, a conceptual architecture for Information FlowControl (IFC) policy enforcement in lightweight programmabledata planes (PDP) virtualization solutions. In contrast to existing solutions for preventing Cross-App Poisoning Attacks (CAP) like ProvSDN, our solution can monitor and prevent CAP attackslaunched against lightweight virtual switches emulated by a general-purpose switch program or composed in a single switch program.
